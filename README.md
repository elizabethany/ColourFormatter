# ColourFormatter

Takes the colour you picked and converts it to the format used in .entities and .decls

## Usage
0. You will be prompted to choose if you want to clear the output files (configurable)
1. Select the name for the colour field. For example, I'd select 'color' for an entity's renderModelInfo. An option to enter a custom name is also available.
2. A colour selection window will open up. Pick a colour, then hit "Okay".
3. The formatted colour will now be written to FormattedColours.txt (configurable). By default, the formatted colour should also be printed to the console.
